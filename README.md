# minepd
Maximal Information Coefficient(MIC) is a tool that can measure the relationship of a series of data, which provided in the Maximal Information-based Nonparametric Exploration (MINE) library
However, the original minepy is a bit mess because it aims to the core function, especially for only np support and print the result for a series of data.
Therefore, this project try to wrap Pandas and Plotly to ... eh ... Make MINE Great Again?(LOL) 
To be honest, this project target is to make MINE more easy to be used by myself, but I think someone will also like to try it.
